# Automated Alert Management and Ticket Creation

This guide describes how to set up an automated system for managing alerts and creating tickets using Prometheus, Alertmanager, Jenkins, and Jira.

## Prerequisites

- Prometheus setup for monitoring
- Alertmanager configured with Prometheus
- Jenkins server with administrative access
- Jira account and project setup

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Setting Up Prometheus Labels

Labels in Prometheus are key to determining what should trigger a ticket. Define labels based on severity, service, and other relevant criteria.

```yaml
# Example Prometheus alert rule with labels
groups:
- name: example
  rules:
  - alert: HighMemoryUsage
    expr: node_memory_Active_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes > 0.85
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
      ticket: true
    annotations:
      summary: High memory usage on {{ $labels.instance }}
```

### 2. Configuring Alertmanager for Alert Handling
Set up Alertmanager to manage alerts generated by Prometheus, specifying which alerts should be escalated to tickets.
```yaml
# Example Alertmanager configuration
route:
  receiver: 'jira-ticket-creator'
  group_by: ['alertname', 'severity']
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 4h
  routes:
  - match:
      ticket: "true"
    receiver: 'jira-ticket-creator'
receivers:
- name: 'jira-ticket-creator'
  webhook_configs:
  - url: 'http://<jenkins-url>/job/create-ticket/buildWithParameters'
```
### 3. Using Jenkins for Automation and Integration
Configure Jenkins to trigger jobs that create tickets in Jira based on alerts from Alertmanager.
```groovy
// Jenkins pipeline script to create Jira tickets
pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        GenericTrigger(
         genericVariables: [
          [key: 'description', value: '$.commonAnnotations.description'],
          [key: 'summary', value: '$.commonAnnotations.summary']
         ],
         causeString: 'Triggered by Alertmanager',
         token: 'JIRA_TRIGGER_TOKEN',
         printContributedVariables: true,
         printPostContent: true
        )
    }
    stages {
        stage('Create Jira Ticket') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Script to create ticket in Jira
                    // Replace with appropriate API call or Jira plugin usage
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### 4. Managing Tickets in Jira
Configure Jira to handle the tickets. Set up project boards, workflows, and priorities to manage the lifecycle of the issues created by Jenkins.

Project Setup: Ensure your Jira project is configured to categorize and prioritize tickets based on the labels sent from Jenkins.
Workflow: Customize the workflow to reflect the process for handling incidents, from ticket creation to resolution.
